    Currency
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>There is no need to exchange your US Dollars. However, there is an exchange bureau at Sandals Emerald Bay. The Bahamian or U.S. Dollar is the legal tender in the Exumas. 
    Most merchants do accept your U.S. Dollars, traveler’s schedules and major credit cards, i.e. VISA®, MasterCard® and American Express®.</span>
    <br>
    <br>

    On-Site Purchases
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>Although everything is included you may also want to enjoy "optional" on-site and off-site experiences, spa treatments, and make phone calls or 
    purchases in the gift shops. You should bring a major credit card for these purchases as all Sandals Resorts are "cashless resorts". 
    Sandal's accepts VISA®, MasterCard®, American Express®, Discover Card® and Traveler’s cheques.</span>
    <br>
    <br>


    Packing Suggestions
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>
        <li>Bring your valid passport and a copy of your passport.</li>
        <li>Remember to tell your bank you are traveling so they don’t flag your card for fraudulent charges.</li>
        <li>If you'd like to use your cell phone check with your provider and insure you have global cellular capabilities added.</li>
        <li>Bring snacks, we've got quite some distance to cover at times the perfect restaurant may be some distance away. </li>
        <li>Don't forget to pack any prescription medications, pain reliever, motion sickness medicine, and toiletries you might need.</li>
        <li>As you know the weather will be warm so pack accordingly but you may want to bring a light jacket or sweater at night.   You may want to bring an umbrella as well. </li>
    </span>

    <br>
    <br>

    Dress Code  
    <br>
    <br>

    <span>
        Pack lightly, one large suitcase with a carry-on is ideal. Casual wear is perfect, except for formal nights, theme nights, 
        and restaurants that require full-length pants and collared shirts; the dress code is listed under each <a href = "https://www.sandals.com/emerald-bay/restaurants/" target= "_blank"  >restaurant description</a>.
    </span>
    <br>
    <br>

    Electrical Outlets
    <br>
    <br>

    <span>
    Electrical outlets are identical to those we use in the USA.  They operate at 120 volts, 60 cycles in the Bahamas. But don’t worry about bringing your hair dryers; they’re already provided in every room.

    Group Agenda <br>
    <br>
    <span>
      Dentist Direct wants you to enjoy your vacation the way you like to vacation thus there are only 2 group events that they would really appreciate you attending.
    <br>
     Saturday Feb. 9th @ 6p.m. – 8p.m. They will be hosting a group dinner – Location TBA
     Thursday Feb. 14th 5p.m. – 6:30p.m. They will be hosting a Closing Cocktail Reception – Location TBA
    </span>

    <br>
    <br>


All of the spa, tour, etc. desks are located in the lobby<br>


Upon arrival you will be asked to check your bags as check in is not until 3p.m.  So, please pack a change of clothes in your carry 
on so you can start enjoying the hotel right away.
  They will notify you when your room is ready<br>


  From the airport to the hotel is a 15 minute drive.  The airport is small and a Sandals rep. will be there to greet you and help direct you to your car.<br>

  there is an ATM on site that dispenses American dollars<br>

  They can choose to golf 9 or 18 holes.  Dentist direct will be covering the rental of your golf cart but golf club rentals will be on your own.<br>

  I recommend that you stick with bottled water on this trip.  Showers and teeth brushing are fine at the resort but I would specifically request bottled water at all
   restaurants, poolside etc. otherwise they will bring you tap water.<br>

Mention that it’s a cash free resort but the only things that could cost you out of pocket are:  Scuba Certification, golf club rentals, upgraded bottle of wine, or gift shop items.  
All of those things must be charged to your room.  Everything else is included.<br>


kimonos is tepenaki and can seat up to 12 otherwise most restaurants take reservations of parties of 6 or less.  I recommend making all of your restaurant reservations, 
golf, excursion and spa appointments on the day of your arrival.  If you are looking to make a reservation with a group of 6 or more for dinner, golf or excursion and know the date and number of people 
I am happy to help you with those arrangements in advance<br>
