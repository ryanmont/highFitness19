                     Amber is the co-owner/co-creator and the creative genuis behind HIGH Fitness. Ambers passion for the HIGH fitness brand and her love of appealing to everyone is a key component to HIGH fitness' success! Amber knows first hand that being who YOU are, listening to your gut, and believing in yourself is the only way to achieve true happiness. Amber's passion for aerobics started as a child watching her mom do the 20 min workout. She saw how much joy it brought to her mom's life which in turn planted a love for fitness and aerobics in her heart. 
<br>
Amber started her fitness career 19 years ago as a Yoga Instructor, which is hysterical once you meet her. Her love for group fitness was sparked by her now business partner Emily Nelson and she credits Emily for literally “changing her life”. Ambers lack of dance experience can be credited for HIGH's simple, easy to follow, intense method of choreography. Amber's hate for diets and love for woman empowerment is obvious and she believes that all women become a 10 when they accept and love who they are. Her goal is to help women see their own beauty. 
<br>
Amber currently teaches and runs HIGH Fitness from Calgary, Canada and travels North America educating and spreading HIGH. Amber can be found at home whenever possible in her PJ's hanging with her husband, two daughters, and havapoo Molly. She is passionate about thrifting, JOMO and Perrier!
